short-description: BlocJams is a new music player.

**Summary**  
BlocJams is a music player that I designed as part of the bloc Web Development Track.

**Explanation**  
BlocJams is a web based music player.

**Problem**  
The music player was designed to teach introductory HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding skills.

**Results**  
Through building the music player several times, I was able to learn a lot of different coding skills. We initially learned about just basic HTML and CSS to design the basic layout of the page. Then the JavaScript was added in order to demonstrate how the user can interact with the page. The last refactoring taught me how to use the jQuery library instead of vanilla JS.

Here is a screenshot.

**Conclusion**  
The final product demonstrates several different coding skills that I learned throughout the process.
