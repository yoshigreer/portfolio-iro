title: My Frontend Developer Goals
---
I have a couple goals as a frontend developer. The first is to design a website that is easy and intuitive to use and navigate from an end-user perspective. I think that it is extremely important that a website is functional for everybody who might use it. The next goal is aesthetics. It is important that the visual aspect of a website is appealing to the eyes. Another important goal of a frontend developer is to make sure the code is efficient. Depending on how things are written, the page may be more or less responsive. It is important for a website to be responsive even for people that don't have a fast internet connection. This can be achieved by using code that is efficiently written.
