title: My Experience at Bloc
---
I decided to join Bloc in order to change career paths. I have always had a general interest in computers and electronic devices. In college, I played around with linux on my computer. I also have always tinkered with my cellphones as far as unlocking and jailbreaking them. My interest in coding in general came after I took a C++ class for my mechanical engineering degree. I also learned a little bit about a couple of other languages during my schooling.

It has recently become a major goal of mine to find a job that allows me more flexibility as far as location and hours go. I think that web development would be the perfect fit for theses goals.
